\section*{Introduction}
The most tricky thing in C++ is an error catch. Most part of errors
are located in the application level and you can be quite sure that
the library, especially the well known STL, is error free. But what
should you do if your application code is trivial i.e. seems to be
error free but you got a SIGSEGV inside a system library. Most
probably you just felt into a situation that is described in the
article. 

\section{Example}
Lets look at the following code:
\inputminted{c++}{./src/sort.cpp}
What's output does it produces? One can expect the following one:
\begin{minted}{shell}
$ 
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
$
\end{minted}
i.e. the original array has to be displayed. In reality the following
output is produced by gcc 5.5.0 
\footnote{
I used gcc:5 docker image for the compilation
}
\begin{minted}{shell}
$ 
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
$
\end{minted}
As one can see the array is broken. How it can be if every
function in the code snapshot seems to be correct?
