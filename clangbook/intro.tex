\chapter{Introduction}

The \mintinline{text}{clang} is C/C++ and ObjC compiler. It's an
integral part of LLVM 
project. When we say about clang we can say about 2 different
things. The first one is the compiler front-end i.e. the part of
compiler that is responsible for parsing and semantic reasoning about
the program. We also use the word \mintinline{text}{clang} when we say
about the compiler itself. It's also referred as compiler driver. The
driver is responsible for compiler invocation i.e. it can be
considered as a manger that calls different parts of the
compiler such as the compiler
front-end as well as other parts that are required for successful
compilation (middle-end, back-end, assembler, linker).

The book is mostly focused on the \mintinline{text}{clang} compiler
front-end but it also includes some other relevant parts of
LLVM that are critical for the front-end internals.

The book is separated into several parts. The first one provides basic
info about LLVM project and how it can be installed. It also describes
useful development tools and configurations used for LLVM code
exploration later in the book.

Second part is about \mintinline{text}{clang} architecture and its
place inside LLVM.

The primary part of the book is about different features of clang such as C++
modules, header maps and others.

The \mintinline{text}{clang} follows primary paradigm of LLVM -
everything is a library, that allows to create a bunch of different
tools. Some of them are also describ
Architecture

design is described and also practical code examples provided
\cite{github:clangbook_src}.
