\chapter{Introduction}

The \mintinline{text}{clang} is C/C++ and ObjC compiler. It's an
integral part of LLVM 
project. When we say about clang we can say about 2 different
things. The first one is the \myindex{compiler frontend} i.e. the part of
compiler that is responsible for parsing and semantic reasoning about
the program. We also use the word \clang when we say
about the compiler itself. It's also referred as compiler driver. The
driver is responsible for compiler invocation i.e. it can be
considered as a manger that calls different parts of the
compiler such as the compiler
frontend as well as other parts that are required for successful
compilation (middle-end, back-end, assembler, linker).

The book is mostly focused on the \clang compiler
frontend but it also includes some other relevant parts of
LLVM that are critical for the frontend internals.

The book is separated into several parts. The first one provides basic
info about LLVM project and how it can be installed. It also describes
useful development tools and configurations used for LLVM code
exploration later in the book.

Second part is about \clang architecture and its
place inside LLVM.

The primary part of the book is about different features of clang such as C++
modules, header maps and others.

The \clang follows primary paradigm of LLVM -
everything is a library, that allows to create a bunch of different
tools. Some of them are also described: clang-tidy, clangd and others

The book also includes a lot of different examples that can be found at
\cite{github:clangbook_src}.
