\chapter{Basic libraries and tools}
LLVM has been written with C++ language and currently (July 2022) uses c++17
version of the C++ standard \cite{llvm:cpp17migration}. From other side it has a
lot internal implementations for basic containers with primary goal of
performance. It's crucial to be familiar with the extensions if you want to work
with LLVM and clang. LLVM also introduced some additional development tools such
as TableGen - DSL (domain specific language) for structural data processing and
LIT (LLVM test framework). You can find some info about the tools here.
