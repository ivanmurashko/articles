\chapter{Basic libraries and tools}
LLVM has been written in C++ language and currently (July 2022) uses the c++17
version of the C++ standard \cite{llvm:cpp17migration}. On the other side, it
has a lot of internal implementations for fundamental containers with the
primary goal of performance. Therefore, being familiar with the extensions is
crucial if you want to work with LLVM and clang. In addition, LLVM also
introduced additional development tools such as TableGen - DSL (domain-specific
language) for structural data processing and LIT (LLVM test framework). You can
find some info about the tools here.
