\chapter{IDE support and code navigation}
The chapter is about Language Server Protocol (LSP) and how it can be used to extend
your IDE. As the primary IDE we will use VSCode. LLVM has its own implementation
of LSP as clangd. We will start with typical usage scenario, continue with
implementation details and will finish with our custom extension for LSP that
has to be implemented on both client (VSCode extension) and server (clangd)
side.
