\chapter{Advanced code analysis}
The clang-tidy checks from previous chapter can be considered are based on an
advanced matching provided by AST. It might be not enough when you want to
detect some complex problems, such as lifetime issues. We will introduce some
advanced code analysis tools based on CFG (control flow graph). The clang static
analyser is a good example of such tools but we also have some CFG integration
into clang-tidy. The chapter will start with typical usage examples, continue
with implementation details. we will finish with our custom check that uses the
advanced techniques.
