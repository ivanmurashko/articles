\chapter{clang-tidy linter framework}
There is an introduction into clang-tidy - the clang based linter framework that
uses AST to find anti patterns at the C/C++/ObjC code. We will start with
clang-tidy description, what kind of checks it has and how they can be
used. Later we will investigate the clang-tidy architecture and how we can
create our custom lint check.
