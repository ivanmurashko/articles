\section{Experiment}
Record/erase experiments at the double phase conjugation mirror
are discussed at the paper.  
The experimental facility is shown at Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_scheme}. The
photorefractive crystal ($C$) is illuminated by two incoherent light
beams from two lasers $L_1$ and $L_2$. At our experiment the beam from
$L_1$ was transmitted via a diffuser $D$ that can be considered as a
model of an optical image. There are 2 conjugated beams as the result
of self-diffraction of initial light beams. One of the conjugated beams
can be detected at photo-detector $PH$ after reflection from
semi-transparent mirror $M_3$.

The recording/erasing experiments are done in the following way. The
light beam from second laser $L_2$  was interlaped in a time period
that was called as erase time. Then the source was opened and another
time period was measured. The time period was called as
reconstruction time and determined by restore the conjugated wave to
$0.7$ of steady-state level.
