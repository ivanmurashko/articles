\section{CONCLUSION.}

\noindent A set of equations for the self-diffraction in the multimode 
semilinear generator geometry is presented.  Sample data of the
numerical simulation as well as experimental measurements using
BSO crystal are given. Numerical simulation and experiment corresponds
each other. We've found explanation of ``landing''  that take priority
of steady-state condition.
