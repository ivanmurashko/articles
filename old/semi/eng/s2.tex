\noindent The geometry of the semilinear generator is
presented on the Fig. 1. In the given geometry, the pump wave from
one side (at the left) is supplied by a laser, and on the other
side (on the right) the pump is the wave reflected from the
resonator's mirror.

wave is supposed to have complex structure after passing through
the transparent plate T.}

The theory of the semilinear generator was developed
proceeding from the theory of the double phase conjugation mirror
\cite{ourDPCM} at our earlier paper \cite{ourSemi}. The system of
equation \cite{ourSemi} was deduced for singlemode oscillations.  The
main goal  of the present investigation was to research semilinear
generator with multimode oscillations.

In addition to those assumptions which were accepted in
\cite{ourSemi}, we assume, that field $\vec{E_2}$ can be expanded over
the system of the resonator modes. Let's assume that the phase
distribution of a mode is $\vec{e_2}^{(i)}$, where $i$ is the index of
the mode. Also we'll assume that some modes are
allocated. Thus field $\vec{E_2}$ is  described by the following
equation (see Fig.
\ref{figTD3_gen}):
\[ 
\vec{E}_2=\sum_i \vec{E}_{2s}^{(i)} +\vec{E}_{2c} + \vec{E}_{2d} + \vec{E}_{2f}, 
\] 
\noindent where $\vec{E}_{2s}^{(i)}$ is a set of allocated modes
(signal wave), all
non-allocated modes considered in $\vec{E}_{2d}$ (with distribution
$\vec{e_d}$),  $\vec{E}_{2c}$ and
$\vec{E}_{2f}$ can are described by analogy with \cite{ourSemi}.

\input ./fig_td2_gen.tex

We write the field on the left as well as \cite{ourSemi}(see Fig.
\ref{figTD2_gen}):
\[
\vec{E}_1=\vec{E}_{1s}+\sum_i \vec{E}_{1c}^{(i)}+\vec{E}_{1f}, 
\]
\noindent where $\vec{E}_{1s}$ - is the signal wave having
structure of a wave falling on the crystal at the left (with
distribution $\vec {e_1}$); $\vec {E}_{1c}^{(i)}$ is the set of
conjugated waves (resonator's modes), $\vec {E}_{1f}$ has the meaning 
of the rest which is a wave scattered on
the on the random inhomogeneities of the refraction index.

The fields contained in $\vec {E}_1$, we consider in the following form:
\[
\vec{E}_{1s}=A_{1s}(z,t)\vec{e}_1(\vec{r})e^{-i(\vec{k}_1\vec{r})},
\]
\[
\vec{E}_{1c}^{(i)}=A^{(i)}_{1c}(z,t)\vec{e}_2^{(i)\ast}
(\vec{r})e^{i(\vec{k}_2\vec{r})}, 
\]
\[
\vec{E}_{1f}=A_{1f}(z,t)\vec{e}_{1f}(\vec{r},t)e^{i(\vec{k}_2\vec{r})}, 
\]
\noindent where $\vec{e}_1(\vec{r})$ - is the distribution of the
undistorted (signal) wave incident from the left side of the
crystal; $\vec{e}_2(\vec{r})$ is the distribution of the signal
wave from the right side; $\vec{e}_{1f}(\vec{r},t)$ is the
distribution of fanning.

The components of $\vec{E}_2$ can be written similarly:
\[
\vec{E}_{2s}^{(i)}=A^{(i)}_{2s}(z,t)\vec{e}_2^{(i)}(\vec{r})
e^{-i(\vec{k}_2\vec{r})},
\]
\[
\vec{E}_{2c}=A_{2c}(z,t)\vec{e}_1^\ast(\vec{r})e^{i(\vec{k}_1\vec{r})}, 
\]
\[
\vec{E}_{2d}=A_{2d}(z,t)\vec{e}_d(\vec{r})e^{-i(\vec{k}_2\vec{r})}, 
\]
\[
\vec{E}_{2f}=A_{2f}(z,t)\vec{e}_{2f}(\vec{r},t)e^{i(\vec{k}_1\vec{r})}.
\]

Thus we can get the following system of equations by analogy with
\cite{ourSemi}.
First is a set of material equations:
\begin{eqnarray}  
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}} 
+\frac{1}{\tau_{eff}}
\left(
1 + i \frac{E_D}{E_q}
\right)
\right) M^{(i)}
= 
i \Gamma B^{(i)} 
\frac{A_{1s}^{\ast}A_{1c}^{(i)}+A_{2s}^{(i)\ast}A_{2c}}{I_0}
+ \frac{M_0^{(i)}}{\tau_{eff}},
\nonumber \\
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}} 
+\frac{1}{\tau_{eff}}
\left(
1 + i \frac{E_D}{E_q}
\right) 
\right) 
{M_{1f}} = 
i\Gamma C_1 \frac{A_{1s}^{\ast}A_{1f}}{I_0}
+ \frac{M_{1f_0}}{\tau_{eff}},
\nonumber \\
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}} 
+\frac{1}{\tau_{eff}}
\left(
1 + i \frac{E_D}{E_q}
\right) 
\right) 
{M_{2f}^{(i)}} = 
i\Gamma C_2^{(i)} \frac{A_{2s}^{(i)\ast}A_{2f}}{I_0}
+ \frac{M_{2f_0}^{(i)}}{\tau_{eff}},
\nonumber \\
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}} 
+\frac{1}{\tau_{eff}}
\left(
1 + i \frac{E_D}{E_q}
\right) 
\right) 
{M_d} = 
i \Gamma C_d \frac{A_{2c} A_{2d}^{\ast}}{I_0}
+ \frac{M_{d_0}}{\tau_{eff}},
\nonumber \\
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}} 
+\frac{1}{\tau_{eff}}
\left(
1 + i \frac{E_D}{E_q}
\right) 
\right) 
{M_{fd}} = 
i \Gamma C_{fd} \frac{A_{2f} A_{2d}^{\ast}}{I_0} +
\frac{M_{fd_0}}{\tau_{eff}},
\label{eqGrating_gen} 
\end{eqnarray} 
\noindent where coefficients $B^{(i)}$, $C_1$ and $C_2^{(i)}$ (see
\cite{ourSemi}) meet the conditions: 
\[
B^{(i)} = \left.const\right|_t < 1,
C_1 = \left.const\right|_t < 1,
C_2^{(i)} = \left.const\right|_t < 1.
\]
These  coefficients
depend upon the spatial distributions of the light fields as well as \cite{ourSemi}. The
value of $B^{(i)}$ is determined by $\vec{e}_1$ and $\vec{e}_2^{(i)}$. The
values of $C_1$ and $C_2^{(i)}$ can be estimated taking into account
reasonable assumptions concerning the fanning distributions.

Second is a system that describes $\vec E_1$ field:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial{A_{1s}}}{\partial{z}} = 
- i D \left\{ 
 A_{1f} M_{1f}^\ast + \sum_i A_{1c}^{(i)}M^{(i)\ast}\right\},
\nonumber \\
\frac{\partial{A_{1c}^{(i)}}}{\partial{z}} = - 
i D A_{1s} M^{(i)},
\nonumber \\
\frac{\partial{A_{1f}}}{\partial{z}} = 
- i D A_{1s} M_{1f}.
\label{eqAmpl_left_gen}
\end{eqnarray}

Third is a system that describes $\vec E_2$ field:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial{A_{2c}}}{\partial{z}} = 
i D \left\{ 
 A_{2d} M_d + \sum_i A_{2s}^{(i)} M^{(i)} \right\},
\nonumber \\
\frac{\partial{A_{2s}^{(i)}}}{\partial{z}} = 
i D \left\{
A_{2c} M^{(i)\ast}
+
A_{2f} M_{2f}^{(i)\ast}
\right\}, 
\nonumber \\
\frac{\partial{A_{2d}}}{\partial{z}} = 
i D \left\{
A_{2c} M_d^\ast
+
A_{2f} M_{fd}^\ast
\right\},
\nonumber \\
\frac{\partial{A_{2f}}}{\partial{z}} = 
i D  \left\{ 
 A_{2d} M_{fd} + \sum_i A_{2s}^{(i)} M_{2f}^{(i)} \right\}.
\label{eqAmpl_right_gen}
\end{eqnarray}

The initial conditions of the equation set are zero ones. The
boundary conditions from left are the following:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left. A_{1s} \right|_{z=0} = A_{1s_0},
\nonumber \\
\left. A_{1c}^{(i)} \right|_{z=0} = 0,
\nonumber \\
\left. A_{1f} \right|_{z=0} = 0.
\label{eqBoundary_left_gen}
\end{eqnarray}
Boundary condition from right side are the following:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left. A_{2s}^{(i)} \right|_{z=d} = r \left. A_{1c}^{(i)} \right|_{z=d},
\nonumber \\ 
\left. A_{2c} \right|_{z=d} = 0,
\nonumber \\ 
\left. A_{2d} \right|_{z=d} = r \left. A_{1f} \right|_{z=d},
\nonumber \\ 
\left. A_{2f} \right|_{z=d} = 0,
\label{eqBoundary_right_gen}
\end{eqnarray}
where $r$ take into account resonator losses.
