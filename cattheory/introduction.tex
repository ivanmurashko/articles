\chapter*{Introduction}

There is an introduction to Category Theory. There are a lot of
examples in each chapter. The examples covers different category
theory application areas. I assume that the reader is familiar with
the corresponding area if not the example(s) can be passed. Anyone can
choose the most suitable example(s). 

The most important examples are related to the set theory. The set
theory and category theory are very close related. Each one can be
considered as an alternative view to another one.

There are a lot of examples from programming languages. There are
Haskell, Scala, C++. The source files for programming languages
examples (Haskell, C++, Scala) can be found on github repo
\cite{bib:github:ivanmurashko}.  

The examples from physics are related to quantum mechanics that is the
most known for me. For the examples I am inspired by the Bob Coecke
article \cite{bib:arxiv:Bob_Coecke_2008}.
