\chapter*{Introduction}

There is an introduction to Category Theory. 

The first chapter keeps base definition and several examples. The most
important one is the example from Set theory. There are also examples
from programming languages (Haskell, C++, Scala) and physics.

The source files for programming languages examples (Haskell, C++,
Scala) can be found on github repo \cite{bib:github:ivanmurashko}
