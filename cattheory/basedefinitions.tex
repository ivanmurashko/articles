\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Object}

\begin{definition}[Class]
  A class is a collection of sets (or sometimes other mathematical
  objects) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all
  its members share. 
  \label{def:class}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Object]
\label{def:object}
In category theory object is considered as something that does not
have internal structure (aka point) but has a property that makes
different objects belong to the same \mynameref{def:class}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[Class of Objects]
\label{rem:objclass}
The \mynameref{def:class} of \mynameref{def:object}s will be marked as 
$\mathrm{ob}(C)$
\end{remark}

\subsection{Morphism}
Morphism is a kind of relation between 2 \mynameref{def:object}s. 
\begin{definition}[Morphism]
\label{def:morphism}
A relation between two \mynameref{def:object}s $a$ and $b$ 
\[
f_{ab}: a \rightarrow b
\]
is called
\textit{morphism}. Morphism assumes a direction i.e. one \mynameref{def:object}
($a$) is called \textit{source} and another one ($b$) \textit{target}.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Commutative diagram]
  A commutative diagram is a diagram of \mynameref{def:object}s (also known as
  vertices) and \mynameref{def:morphism}s (also known as arrows or
  edges) such that all directed paths in the diagram with the same
  start and endpoints lead to the same result by composition
  \label{def:commutativediagram}

  The following diagram commutes if $f_{ab} = f_{cb} \circ f_{ac}$.

  \begin{tikzpicture}[description/.style={fill=white,inner sep=2pt}]
    \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes, row sep=3em,
      column sep=2.5em, text height=1.5ex, text depth=0.25ex]
            { A& & B \\
              & C & \\ };
            %\draw[double,double distance=5pt] (m-1-1) â€“ (m-1-3);
            \path[->]
            (m-1-1) edge node[description] {$ f_{ab} $} (m-1-3)
            edge node[description] {$  f_{ac} $} (m-2-2)
            (m-2-2) edge node[description] {$  f_{cb} $} (m-1-3);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{definition}


\begin{remark}[Class of Morphisms]
\label{rem:morphclass}
The \mynameref{def:class} of \mynameref{def:morphism}s will be marked as 
$\mathrm{hom}(C)$
\end{remark}
