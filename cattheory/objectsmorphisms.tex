\chapter{Objects and morphisms}

\section{Equality}

The important question is how can we decide whenever an
object/morphism is equal to another object/morphism? The trivial
answer is possible for if an \mynameref{def:object} is a
\mynameref{def:set}. In this case we can say that 2 objects are equal
if they contains the same elements. Unfortunately we cannot do the
same for default objects as soon as they don't have any internal
structure. We can use the same trick as in
\mynameref{rem:set_vs_category}: if we cannot use ``microscope'' lets
use ``telescope'' and define the equality of objects and morphisms of
a category $c$ in the terms of whole $\mathrm{hom}(C)$.
