\chapter{Monads}

Monads are very important for pure functional programming languages
such as Haskell. We will start with formal mathematical definition and
will continue with programming languages examples later.

\section{Category of endofunctors}
The \mynameref{ex:fun_category} is an example of a category. We can
apply additional limitation and consider only
\mynameref{def:endofunctor}s i.e. we will look at the category
$[\cat{C}, \cat{C}]$ - category of functors from category $\cat{C}$ to
the same category.
