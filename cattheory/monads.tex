\chapter{Monads}

Monads are very important for pure functional programming languages
such as Haskell. We will start with formal mathematical definition and
will continue with programming languages examples later.

\begin{definition}[Monad]
  \label{def:monad}
  The monad $M$ is an \mynameref{def:endofunctor} with 2
  \mynameref{def:nt}s:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\eta: \idf{C} \tont M$
  \item $\mu: M \circ M \tont M$
  \end{enumerate}
  where $\idf{C}$ is \mynameref{def:idfunctor}.

  The $\eta, \mu$ should satisfy the following conditions:

\end{definition}

%% \section{Category of endofunctors}
%% When 

%% The \mynameref{ex:fun_category} is an example of a category. We can
%% apply additional limitation and consider only
%% \mynameref{def:endofunctor}s i.e. we will look at the category
%% $[\cat{C}, \cat{C}]$ - category of functors from category $\cat{C}$ to
%% the same category.

%% Lets continue to add our limitations and consider the category of
%% endofunctors that consists only one object
%% i.e. \mynameref{def:monoid}. 

TBD
